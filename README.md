# Project Title: Impacts of Marijuana Legalization

![WeedGIF](Images/3-Readme-Gif.gif)

## Objective:
Recreational marijuana is always a hotly debated subject. Through this project, we wanted to understand the Impact of legalizing recreational Marijuana on the States. We will be doing an exploration of various factors like GDP, Population, Employment etc. to draw pre- and post-legalization effects. Through our project, we aim to study and understand several facts and figures to find the answer to the question "Is the criticism of recreational marijuana fair?".

## Dataset:
The dataset we will be using contains information about the states that have legalized marijuana and the key metrics that have been affected. Specifically, the dataset includes information on:
1. **Population**
2. **Employment**
![Employment](Images/2-Employment.jpg)
3. **Unemployment Rates**
4. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**
5. **Tax Revenue**

## Statistical Testing:
1. Since population and GDP have a natural trend of increasing over years, we need to conduct statistical analysis to determine whether legalization of weed has affected that trend.
2. Since we assume the homogeneity of variance in our pre- and post-legalization population samples, we can perform a z-test.
3. Our null-hypothesis assumes that the true mean difference between the paired samples is zero which means any difference between pre- and post metrics is due to random variation.
4. Our alternative hypothesis assumes that the true mean difference between the paired samples is not equal to zero and it might be due to herb legalization.

## Future Scope:
1. Dive further into other key elements such as Vehicle Accident Rates and explore how these are affected by the legalization of Marijuana.
2.  Study the costs associated with Marijuana legalization such as Drug Testing, Litigation, Police, License etc. To weigh all the pros and cons to decide whether it's profitable or not.
3. Compute predictions on GDP, population, uneployment etc for the state of Texas should it legalize cannabis.
